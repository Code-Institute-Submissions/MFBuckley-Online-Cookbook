# Online Cookbook

A database of cooking recipes for the Thermomix kitchen appliance that can be edited and updated.
Created by the Vorwerk company, a Thermomix is essentially a powerful blender which also cooks, kneads and stirs food mixtures making it a powerful ally in the kitchen.

# UX

1. As a back-end developer, I am creating a database of recipes so that it can be searched and updated by a user.

1. As a front-end developer I am creating a responsive webpage using Bootstrap4 so that it works well on all screen sizes.
